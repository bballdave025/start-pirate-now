Learning R (arrghh).

# Learning R

I'm looking all over online for some basic R learning.
I'll start by doing the coding in a Jupyter notebook,
but will move on to R Studio (or however it's called).
I'm planning to eventually move on to a LinkedIn
course or something on Udemy, Coursera, EdX, etc.

I'm glad to have an excuse to learn R and get the
statistical side of things. There's a job or two that
interest me for which knowing R or Python is
recommended. I know Python pretty well, and I'll now
get some basics of R.

The name of the repo, start-pirate-now, comes from my
wonderful joke about the <em>R</em> programming
language and the <em>arrghh</em> of pirates. Yes, I'm
a dad.

I will probably end up putting this source information
into a TXT file, but I'll keep track of them (and, in
the process, make sure I have archived copies) in this
section, for the moment.
